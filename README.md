# *Introduction*:
'ColdMail' is a large language models (LLMs) based cold email generator system built using LangChain, Llama 3.1, Groq, ChromaDB, and Streamlit. 
This system will provide a streamlit based user interface where the user gives a job posting or circular link as an input, 
and then this tool automates creating specific domain based cold emails for software service companies or freelancers by extracting job skills from job posting websites or circular and generates emails with tailored portfolio links. 
These emails contain pertinent links to portfolios that were found in a vector database according to the job requirements.
